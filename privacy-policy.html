        <p>We will never sell, rent, or share any of your personal data with anyone.</p>

        <p>We don’t collect any personal data unless you enable location and notifications within the application. If these are enabled we store your latitude, longitude, and other notification settings, but we still don’t associate it with any personally identifying information.</p>

        <p>If notifications are disabled we still transmit—but do not store—your latitude and longitude in order to calculate golden hour and other such daylight timings for your current location, but we don’t associate it with any personally identifying information.</p>

        <p>To prevent latitude and longitude from being sent, you can turn off Location Services, however we will be unable to do any calculations.</p>

        <p>If you signed up to be notified of launch, or to become a beta tester, your email address will not be shared with anyone but ourselves. We will only use this information to contact you with regards to the launch of Rizon, or with information on joining our tester program. We don’t associate your email address with any personally identifying information.</p>

        <p>We also use <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> to collect usage statistics. This data is anonymous, and does not transmit any personally identifying information to either Google or ourselves.</p>

        <p class="mb4">If you have any questions, please email us directly at: <a href="mailto:mail@rizonapp.co">mail@rizonapp.co</a></p>
